# Ein-Aus Knopf
A C# (CSharp) Windows Forms App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. Just a tiny program that requires you to type the right code to be able to close it. (the correct code is "123456")

*"Zustandsdiagramm.docx" represents the instructions for the project.*

*To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch "EinAusKnopf.exe" located in "bin/Release/net7.0-windows".*

*Note: german language used.*
