# Ein-Aus Knopf

A C# Windows Forms App exercise project, developed during my retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. This small program simulates a toggle button for a machine that can only be switched between ON and OFF states by entering the correct code ("123456"). The window can only be closed when the state is ON.


## How to Run

To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch `EinAusKnopf.exe` located in `bin/Release/net7.0-windows`.

**Note:** German language used.

**The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.**
